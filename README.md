This is a final project.
The main purpose of this is to demonstrate my skills with Javascript, HTML and CSS (the php file is an addition that i decided to add myself).

Files and Folders:
assets - contains all necessary images for the website to work
about.html - This file is for the about section of the hypothetical company.
contact.html - This file contains all the necessary fields and forms in order to contact someone at said company.
index.html - This file is the main landing page for the user.
script.js - This file containts the necessary logic to make the Gallery view work.
style.css - This file is responsible for most of the styling of all the html files.
submit.php - This file is used to process the form submission (Does not work on github pages). Tested and worked on a vps.


Output:
Index.html - This is the main landing page which gives a quick overview of services provided and includes a form in order for the user to get a quote from the company.

about.html - Displays a little bit about the company itself and renders some images that are AI generated using Bing.

contact.html - Displays a way to contact the company either via form submission similiar to the one in order to get a quote on index.html additionally a email is displayed which allows the user to contact the company seperatly from the form submission.
